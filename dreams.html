    <h2>The Science of Dreams</h2>
    <p>Dreams activate parts of the brain that fuel creativity and innovation. Neuroscience studies show that 
    dreaming helps us process emotions and imagine possibilities beyond our waking consciousness 
    (Harvard Medical School, 2023). History’s greatest achievements—from Einstein’s theory of relativity 
    to groundbreaking art—have roots in dreams.</p>

    <h2>Dreams in Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>We believe that every transformative idea starts as a dream. To dream is to envision a better world; 
    without it, progress halts. However, unchecked dreams without truth can become dangerous fantasies. 
    Our philosophy nurtures purposeful dreams that align with verifiable truth, creating sustainable visions 
    for society.</p>
