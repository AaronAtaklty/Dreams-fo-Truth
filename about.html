    <h2>Our Origin</h2>
    <p><strong>Dreams of Truth</strong> was founded in 2024 after a historic moment in human history—a period where 
    artificial intelligence, rapid technological change, and political divides left many people disillusioned. 
    A group of visionaries asked: <em>What if humanity could dream again while still holding fast to truth?</em></p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We believe that by cultivating meaningful dreams and aligning them with objective truth, individuals and 
    societies can overcome fear, corruption, and stagnation. Our mission is to inspire a global movement of 
    “Dreamers of Truth”—leaders, artists, scientists, and everyday people who dare to imagine and act with 
    integrity.</p>
